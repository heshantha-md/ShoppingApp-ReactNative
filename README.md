# Shopping App Built with React Native Expo

Welcome to the Shopping App! This project was developed using React Native Expo to brush up on my React Native skills and explore the capabilities of Expo. While I really believe in the power and flexibility of React Native CLI, working with Expo has been a whole new level of fun and convenience.

## Features
